ðŸ”Š Hand Gesture Volume Controller using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This program captures real-time video from your webcam and detects your hand using MediaPipe. By measuring the distance between your thumb and index finger, it dynamically adjusts the system volume using Pycaw. A visual volume bar is displayed on screen, and the volume changes as you bring your fingers closer or farther apart. Press 'q' to quit.
